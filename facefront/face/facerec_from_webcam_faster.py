# This is a demo of running face recognition on live video from your webcam. It's a little more complicated than the

# other example, but it includes some basic performance tweaks to make things run a lot faster:

#   1. Process each video frame at 1/4 resolution (though still display it at full resolution)

#   2. Only detect faces in every other frame of video.


# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.

# OpenCV is *not* required to use the face_recognition library. It's only required if you want to run this

# specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.
